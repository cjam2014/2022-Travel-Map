# Maps Javascript API Project Demonstration

This project is a basic demonstration of how Maps JavaScript API from GCP Marketplace can be incorporated into a website. 

This project is a guide to my travel plans for the year of 2022. With so many life milestones happening in one year and so many places to explore while celebrating, I wanted to create a basic demonstration of how to incorporate Maps JavaScript from GCP Marketplace into a web application.
